Finding a "clean" text file specifically for 4-6-year-olds can be tricky because most GitHub repositories for "word lists" are either massive (containing every word in the dictionary) or too technical.

However, there are a few specific public datasets and repositories that contain these "first words." Here are the best raw text/CSV resources I found for your age group:

1. English: The "Safe-Words" List
   This is a curated repository specifically meant for "child-friendly applications." It is much better than a standard dictionary because it removes complex or inappropriate words.

Source: GitHub: The-Best-Codes/safe-words

The File: [verified-words.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Best-Codes/safe-words/main/verified-words.txt)

Why it works: It contains simple, high-frequency nouns and verbs that a 5-year-old would recognize.
