Finding a "clean" text file specifically for 4-6-year-olds can be tricky because most GitHub repositories for "word lists" are either massive (containing every word in the dictionary) or too technical.

However, there are a few specific public datasets and repositories that contain these "first words." Here are the best raw text/CSV resources I found for your age group:

1. English: The "Safe-Words" List
   This is a curated repository specifically meant for "child-friendly applications." It is much better than a standard dictionary because it removes complex or inappropriate words.

Source: GitHub: The-Best-Codes/safe-words

The File: verified-words.txt

Why it works: It contains simple, high-frequency nouns and verbs that a 5-year-old would recognize.

2. Dutch: Basiswoordenlijst Amsterdamse Kleuters (BAK)
   This is the "official" gold standard for Dutch vocabulary for ages 4-6. While often found in PDFs, researchers have put it into structured formats.

The List: Search for the BAK-lijst. It contains 3,000 words (2,000 core + 1,000 extension).

Raw Data Alternative: The repository bzdgn/dutch-vocabulary contains a file called dutch-meaning.csv which is very simple and covers basic adjectives (happy, big, small) and nouns.

3. French: Lexique.org (Children's Subset)
   For French, the most scientific source is Lexique.org, which has a specific "Books for Children" frequency list.

Source: SinaC/Lexique on GitHub

Content: This file contains thousands of words, but you can filter it by the "frequency" column to get the top 500-1000 words, which are almost exclusively the words taught in Maternelle and CP (ages 4-7).

4. Cross-Language: Basic Vocabulary CSV
   If you want one file that has multiple languages side-by-side, this repository is excellent for basic nouns (colors, animals, household objects).

Source: CodingFriends/basic-vocabulary-word-lists

The File: Look in the wordlists folder for en-fr or similar CSV files. It's limited to about 200-500 words, making it perfect for the 4-6 age range.
